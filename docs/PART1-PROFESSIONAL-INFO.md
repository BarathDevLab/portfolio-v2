🌟 About Me

Hi, I’m Bharath G, a developer passionate about building scalable, user-focused web and mobile applications. I work across React, Next.js, Flutter (BLoC), and integrate powerful backend services using Firebase, Firestore, and REST APIs.

I enjoy taking ideas from concept to deployment — whether it’s a clean UI website, a production-ready Flutter app, or an automated workflow using n8n. My projects span real-time apps, AI-powered utilities, authentication systems, and event-based mobile applications.

I’m currently expanding my skills in DevOps, focusing on Docker, GitHub Actions, cloud deployments, and Linux fundamentals to improve reliability and automation in my deployments.

Across all my work, my goal is simple:
Build high-quality digital products that are fast, reliable, and meaningful for users.

When I’m not coding, I explore AI tools, automation workflows, and new ways to optimize the development process. I love learning, experimenting, and building things that solve real problems.
